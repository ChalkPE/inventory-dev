We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy, propriety, or timeliness of any third party or User Content.

We therefore encourage you to independently confirm with other sources any data, images, information, suggestions, guidance or other materials or Content made available on or through the Site or Services.</p>
          <p>How Grailed&rsquo;s Services Work. As part of the Services, you or other Grailed users may choose to post information to the Services about goods that you or such other users would like to offer for sale to other Grailed users (such information, a &ldquo;Listing,&rdquo; and such users, &ldquo;Sellers&rdquo;). Other Grailed users who may be potential buyers (&ldquo;Buyers&rdquo;) may ask the applicable Seller questions and offer to pay an amount of money of their choosing in order to obtain the goods included in the applicable Listing. If a Seller accepts such an offer or makes a counter-offer, the applicable potential Buyer(s) will be sent a link through the Services that will provide them with the opportunity to checkout via a third party payment processor (a &ldquo;Payment Processor&rdquo;). A Seller is free to accept and counter offers of multiple potential Buyers simultaneously. The first potential Buyer to successfully submit the agreed upon payment amount (whether an offer or counteroffer) to a Seller will become the winner of such goods (such Buyer, the &ldquo;Winning Buyer&rdquo;). If such Seller Accepts Payment (as defined below), that Seller will ship such goods to the applicable address provided to such Seller by such Winning Buyer in accordance with this Agreement, at which time such Winning Buyer will become the owner of such goods.</p>
          <p>Third Party Services. The Services may permit you to link to other websites, services or resources on the Internet (&ldquo;Third Party Sites&rdquo;), and other websites, services or resources may contain links to the Services, in each case, such as a Payment Processor that you may choose to link to your Account or otherwise use in connection with the Services. When you access Third Party Sites on the Internet, you do so at your own risk. These other resources are not under our control, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply our endorsement or any association between us and their operators. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such website or resource.</p>
          <p>Listing and Purchase Conditions.</p>
          <p>a Listing Conditions. As part of the Services, you may choose to post a Listing to the Services. You hereby acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are solely responsible for the accuracy and content of any Listing; (ii) we cannot guarantee exact Listing durations; (iii) User Content, including without limitation any Listing, that violates this Agreement may be modified or deleted at our sole discretion; (iv) we may modify or move certain Listings from one marketplace to another (e.g., from Grailed to Grailed Basics) at our sole discretion; (v) we reserve the right in our sole discretion to delete any Content (including Listings) for any reason whatsoever without notice to you, including without limitation because we believe for any reason that a Listing may include replica (and not original) or counterfeit items or for curatorial or editorial reasons; (vi) [appearance or placement of Listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors (for example, buyer's or seller&rsquo;s location, search query and history) and, as such, a Listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer]; (vii) when you receive payment from an applicable Winning Buyer equal or greater to the amount of money offered by such Winning Buyer or counteroffered by you, as applicable, in connection with an applicable Listing in accordance with the process set forth in Section 5 above, you must use the Services to notify such Winning Buyer within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of such payment whether you intend (A) to reject and refund to such Winning Buyer the full amount of payment that you received and not send such goods to such Winning Buyer (&ldquo;Reject Payment&rdquo;) , which refund you agree to remit to such Winning Buyer in full within than seventy-two (72) hours after you Reject Payment, or (B) to accept and keep such payment and agree to ship such goods to such Winning Buyer (&ldquo;Accept Payment&rdquo;) within fourteen (14) calendar days after you Accept Payment; (viii) if you Accept Payment, you enter into a legally binding contract with the applicable Winning Buyer, pursuant to which (A) you agree to ship such goods to such Winning Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and (B) title to and ownership of such goods automatically passes to that Winning Buyer upon your shipment of such goods; and (ix) we do not transfer legal ownership of applicable goods from an applicable Seller to an applicable Winning Buyer and have no responsibility or liability in connection therewith.</p>
          <p>b. Purchase Conditions. As part of the Services, you may submit an offer to buy goods included in a Listing through the Services. All goods included in Listings are provided by Grailed users and not Grailed. You hereby acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are solely responsible for reading the full item listing before offering a bid or commitment to buy; (ii) when you use the Services to commit to pay a certain amount of money to an applicable Seller for goods included in an applicable Listing and you are notified through the Services that such Seller accepts such offer, you enter into a legally binding contract with such Seller to attempt in good faith to purchase such goods in accordance with the process described in Section 5 above; and (iii) we do not transfer legal ownership of items from the Seller to the Winning Buyer and have no responsibility or liability in connection therewith; (iv) your purchases through the Services are transactions between you and the applicable Grailed user and not with us or any of our affiliates; (v) we do not in any instances make any representations, warranties or guarantees as to whether an applicable Seller will choose to Accept Payment or Reject Payment, and we have no liability to you with respect to any such choice; (vi) we are not a party to your payment transaction for such purchases; (vii) we do not employ or control any Third Party Sites, (viii) we do not design, manufacture, store, ship or otherwise control any goods or services made available for purchase by Grailed users or Third Party Sites and (ix) we do not make any representations or warranties with regard to any goods made available through the Services or your potential related experiences.</p>
          <p>Prior to purchasing products from any third party (including any Grailed user) described on the Site or Services, you are advised to independently verify the applicable information and read any applicable third parties&rsquo; sales, legal and privacy policies. Although we may choose in our sole discretion to intervene or attempt to resolve a dispute between you and other Grailed users or Third Party Sites, you agree that we have no obligation to do so and that all transactions are ultimately solely between you and the applicable Grailed users or Third Party Site. In order to submit an offer to purchase goods through the Services, you must be at least 18 years old and have a valid Payment Method (as defined below), with full authority to use it.</p>
          <p>Prices; Colors; Availability.</p>
          <p>Any prices of goods included in any Listing are set by the Grailed user that provides the applicable goods and are subject to change.</p>
          <p>Despite our efforts, errors may appear from time to time, and additionally, some of the Content you find on the Services was not created, edited, or posted by us (for example, Listings or user comments, reviews and ratings).</p>
          <p>Although we try to make sure the Services only display accurate prices and offer and counteroffer amounts, and we try to assist in correcting errors as we become aware of them, you may occasionally encounter mispriced goods or inaccurate offer or counteroffer amounts on the Services. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of any Content made available through the Services. Occasionally, there may be information on our Site or Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions, including related to descriptions, pricing, offers or availability of goods included in Listings. If any information on the Site or Services is inaccurate, we reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, change or update information or cancel any transactions through the Services at any time without prior notice.</p>
          <p>Please note that the colors of goods included in Listings may depend on the settings of your monitor or screen, and therefore the color of goods on your display may differ from the goods that you actually receive.</p>
          <p>Although we try to display updated Listings on the Services, the availability of goods on the Services may change at any time, without notice.</p>
          <p>A Seller may decide in its sole discretion whether to Accept Payment or Reject Payment.</p>
          <p>Title and Transaction Restrictions. You acknowledge that at no time will we take title to any goods included in a Listing. You hereby represent and warrant that you are the owner of any goods that you include in a Listing, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances, and when you Accept Payment from another Grailed user who successfully submits payment to you for such goods and becomes the Winning Buyer in accordance with this Agreement, you will ship such goods to such Winning Buyer in accordance with this Agreement, and upon such shipment, title to and ownership of those goods automatically passes to that user. We do not take, assume or transfer legal ownership of any items included in a Listing. You, as a Seller, acknowledge that you hold title to any such items, we are not a consignee, bailee, agent or auctioneer with respect to such items and we are merely an interactive service provider. </p>
          <p>International Buying and Selling; Currency Conversion. Our Services are accessible to international Sellers and Buyers. Sellers and Buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to any international sale, purchase or shipment of goods. If explicitly stated in an applicable Listing, you may restrict international Buyers from purchasing applicable goods using the Services. We may offer certain features or functionality of particular interest to international Sellers and Buyers, such as local currency conversion services (which may be made available or provided by Third Party Sites). The accuracy and availability of any such currency conversion services are not guaranteed.</p>
          <p>Rules of Conduct.</p>
          <p>As a condition of use, you promise not to use the Services for any purpose that is prohibited by these Terms of Service. You are responsible for all of your activity in connection with the Services.<br>

          <p>Payments and Billing.</p>
          <p>Payment Processing. We do not process payments for goods included in Listings posted to the Services – that is handled by a Payment Processor. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the applicable Payment Processor. For each good you purchase through the Services, you agree to pay the agreed upon payment amount for applicable for the goods. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the total charge for any purchase in the amount of an accepted offer or counteroffer in connection with an applicable Listing may include shipping fees and state and local sales tax, the amount of which varies (e.g., due to factors including the type of item purchased and the shipping destination). Each Grailed user shall be solely responsible for all applicable sales taxes, or other taxes, customs, import/export charges or similar governmental charges on orders shipped to any other state or on orders shipped outside the United States.</p>
          <p>Payment Method. The terms of any payment in connection with the Services will be based on the applicable payment method that you authorize through the Services (&ldquo;Payment Method&rdquo;) as may be determined or affected by agreement(s) between you and the applicable Payment Processor, financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.</p>
          <p>Paid Services. Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the &ldquo;Paid Services&rdquo;). Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of this Agreement.</p>
          <p>Billing. We use a Payment Processor to bill you through a payment account linked to your account with the applicable Payment Processor, which account is linked to your Account on the Services (your &ldquo;Billing Account&rdquo;), for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen Payment Method. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>
          <p>Current Information Required. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE THE EMAIL ADDRESS OR ACCESS CREDENTIALS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT WITH AN APPLICABLE PAYMENT PROCESSOR), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD, WHETHER FOR YOUR ACCOUNT ON THE SERVICES OR WITH AN APPLICABLE PAYMENT PROCESSOR. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT YOUR ACCOUNT PAGE. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>
          <p>Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>
          <p>Holds. To protect ourselves from risk of liability for your actions as a Seller, we may at times recommend that an applicable Payment Processor restrict a Seller&rsquo;s use of that Payment Processor&rsquo;s services based on certain factors, including without limitation Selling history, Seller performance, returns, riskiness of the listing category, transaction value or feedback from other Grailed users, which may result in such Payment Processor imposing such restrictions.</p>
          <p>Shipping; Returns. All sales of goods through the Services are binding, final and not eligible for any return or refund of any nature whatsoever. As between us and Sellers, Sellers shall be solely responsible for all shipping costs and customer service issues with respect to any goods sold through the Services at such Seller&rsquo;s sole expense. Winning Buyers must use the Services to provide the address to which the applicable goods will be shipped to an applicable Seller simultaneously with payment for such goods. Such Sellers shall ship the applicable goods to the address of the Winning Buyer (or their indicated recipient) within fourteen (14) days after such Seller Accepts Payment from such Winning Buyer. As between us and Grailed users, Sellers and Buyers shall be solely responsible for (i) determining and agreeing to (A) shipping methods for applicable goods and (B) Sellers&rsquo; and Buyers&rsquo; applicable payment obligations in connection therewith, including payment of any applicable sales or other taxes, and (ii) for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to any sale, purchase or shipment of goods. Sellers shall have the right to determine the shipping methods and costs for the sales of applicable goods and to factor such costs into any decisions of such Seller regarding the acceptance or rejection of any Buyer&rsquo;s offer, such Seller&rsquo;s extension of any counteroffer or whether to Accept Payment or Reject Payment in connection with an applicable Listing.</p>
          <p>Termination. We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership. If you wish to terminate your Account, you may do so by following the instructions on the Site or through the Services. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. All provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, licenses of User Content, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

          <p>Indemnification. You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and each of our and their respective employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the Services, Content, or otherwise from your User Content (including any Listings), any agreement or dispute between Grailed users with respect to any Listing, violation of these Terms of Service, or infringement by you, or any third party using your Account or identity in the Services, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>
